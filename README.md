# Exercise: GitHub Workflow

## Goal of this Exercise:
1. Simulate making code changes on projects and homework
2. Get comfortable with pushing commits to GitHub repo
3. Understanding of how to submit HW via Pull Requests

## Exercise Steps:
1. Make at least 3x different changes to the code in this repo
2. Make sure to **COMMIT** these changes **each time** (so 3x different commits)
3. Push each of these changes up to your **fork**
4. At the end, make a **final**, single Pull Request to the upstream (original) repo

## Bonus:
Now that you understand Git workflow better, pull down + submit some more changes to your Google Clone homework repo

## Before you start:
Make sure to have GitHub Desktop installed https://desktop.github.com/

## Getting Started
1. Fork this repository to create a copy of it on your GitHub account (only do this the first time)
2. Navigate to your forked exercise repository
3. Click **"Clone or Download"** (green button)
4. Select **"Open in Desktop"** - you should have the Desktop app installed before doing this
5. Follow the instructions to download the repo to your computer
6. Have fun coding!

### If you already have the code installed on your computer
you can simply open that project folder in GitHub Desktop

## Committing your Code (GitHub Desktop)

1. In GitHub Desktop - it should show all your code changes already.  Make sure to **commit** your changes (section in the bottom left) with a summary description

2. After committing, the center navigation should be clear
3. Click "Push Origin" on the top

4. Now your work is saved to your GitHub repo - great job!
5. You can always "push your code" to your repo so that it's accessible anywhere you have Internet

## Making a Pull Request
Pull Requests are a way for programmers to submit code change suggestions to an upstream repository
* In our case, the upstream = class repo
* Forked repo = your working repo (or the "origin")

In this class, we'll be using PRs to submit homework, where instructors can check + comment your work

1. Open a Pull Request (from your fork)

2. Make sure all details are correct

3. Press "Create Pull Request" - your instructors will reach out if there are any issues!  Good work!
